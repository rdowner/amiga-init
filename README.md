# Workbench Construction Kit

The Workbench Construction Kit is a tool for creating an Amiga operating system image with lots of useful software, but which leaves it up to you to decide what you want to install. It's opinionated at the micro level (for example, if you install a TCP/IP stack you will automatically get drivers for common NICs) but not at the macro level (it's up to you to decide if you want to install a TCP/IP stack or not). This means that you can get your Amiga configured with the software you prefer without having to answer hundreds of questions of minutia.

The kit is run on a Linux, macOS or similar OS and will generate a hard drive image. You can then copy this image to a real drive, plug it into your Amiga, and finish off the installation. Alternatively the image file can be used immediately with WinUAE and similar Amiga emulators.
