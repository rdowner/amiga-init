  If you need/want to contact me (Stefan Boberg), you can use one of the
addresses listed below. If you don't get a response from the electronic
addresses chances are your messages didn't get through to me. In that case
try sending me a regular letter. Please note that I may be away from home
for a week or two once in a while so it may take some time before I'm able
to respond.
