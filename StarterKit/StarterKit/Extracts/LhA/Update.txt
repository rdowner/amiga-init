V1.38 : August 27 1992

[ Interim release ]

- Fixed `-s' option. Now it finally works. Somehow I forgot to implement
  this before.

- Fixed bug when specifying the same file twice.
  (Roland Bless & Lazarus Marhenke)

V1.37 : Not really released

- Fixed bug in handling of `~', `[' and `]' wildcard tokens. Would not
  work unless national translation was enabled. (Affected V1.32 -> V1.36)
  (Mattias Korsbäck)

V1.36 : August 18 1992

[Miscellaneous bugfixes from LhA V2.00 as an interim solution until it is
released].

- Added code to handle case when LhA is called with a bad environment,
  i.e. all fields in the process structure not correctly initialized.
  This should take care of most problems arising with brain-damaged
  programs such as GCCHost, which fail to set up a CLI structure.

- LhA now respects -x setting with level-[12] headers.

- Added protection for `s:startup-sequence'-type hacks. (A.J. Brouwer)

- Fixed requester suppression bug. Only appeared if you had no LHAOPTS
  environment variable. (Many reports).

V1.35 :

- Added `y' command ("copy archive with new options"). Name says it all.
  See manual for details.

- Added `h' command ("hunt for diffs arc <-> filesys"). This command
  compares the contents of an archive with the contents of the current
  or `destination' directory, and reports any differences. Useful to see
  what files have changed since the last backup/archiving. With this
  command the `-D' option setting affects what method of display is
  used.

V1.34 :

- Fixed bug in SetFDate() which would cause LhA to leave files locked
  until the end of the program, thus disabling the `-Qd' option.

- Fixed bug in level-1 header handling. Would cause LhA to generate
  corrupted entries when a delete/update operation was performed on
  an archive containing level-1 headers with extended headers.

- Added `c' (concatenate) command. With this command it is possible to
  concatenate two or more archives into one, or to append one or more
  archives to another. Currently it does not check for duplicate files.

V1.33 :

- Fixed Enforcer hit in `LhX'.

- Reduced executable size even further by compressing the usage texts.
  Gains 1-2K depending on program version.

- Reduced executable size by approximately 1KB. No change in memory
  requirements however.

- The `-Qq' option is now implemented. When it is enabled LhA will not
  perform the standard archive scan-through before adding files to the
  archive. This will speed up the operation considerably, but can cause
  problems if the archive has no archive terminator (if an update
  operation was aborted with CTRL-C for instance). This also means that
  LhA will not check if a file already exists in the archive; thus a file
  can be added to an archive twice. Useful if you know the files you're
  adding are not already in the archive (Fido Mail-packets for instance).
  (Roger Nordin)

- Now the `-B' option is implemented. When this option is enabled, LhA
  will keep the original archive renamed to `xxx.bak' when files are
  removed from an archive (via the delete, freshen, replace, or update
  commands).

- Now checks that `-P' task priority is in the correct range ( [-5,5] )

- With V37+, now sets WILDSTAR flag in dl_Root->rn_Flags to enable the `*'
  wildcard, which is disabled by default in OS2.x. Many people thought
  this was a bug in LhA, but it really is because when LhA started using
  the V37 dos.library pattern routines, some people did not use a program
  such as `star' or `starburst'. This *WAS* mentioned in the manual.

- With V37+, now uses SetFileDate() to set directory/file dates. With
  pre-V37 uses packets instead.

V1.32 : May 1992

- No longer creates empty archives if no files to add to the new archive
  are found. (Roger Nordin)

- Changed `vv' list output format. The Host OS is now spelled out (i.e.
  `Amiga' and `Unix' instead of `A' and `U' for example).

- Fixed problem where a CTRL-C user break occasionally would cause LhA to
  leave a file locked on exit (extraction only).

- Case conversion with `-u' and `-l' options now also affect archiving as
  intended.

- Added `-Qn' option to optionally enable/disable case conversion of
  national characters. This should be disabled when running 1.3 or 2.04
  with the old FFS and OFS file systems which handles national characters
  incorrectly when calculating filename hash values. With WB2.1 you can
  format `national' filesystem disks (`DOS\2' and `DOS\3', for OFS and FFS
  respectively), which handles these characters correctly. All previous
  versions had national character case conversion *enabled*. It is now
  *disabled* by default.

- Fixed infinite-loop bug in delete command. (Dennis Vasko)

- Fixed `-Y' option. Was broken in earlier versions.

- Fixed `-y' option again to work the way it's supposed to. Previously it
  would not work at all.

- Fixed bug in level 2 header filenote handling. Previously it would emit
  a filename exthdr twice instead of one filename+one filenote exthdr.
  (Gunnar Klauberg)

- The `-C' option (clear arc-bit on extract) is now set by default (as
  the doc says). (forgot who reported this, sorry).

- Added `-Qb' option to force LhA to test an archive before extracting
  anything from it. If the test fails nothing is extracted.

- Added safety check for delete command. The delete command must always
  be specified with `d' only (not `delete' or `del' or anything else,
  just `d'). (Klaus Weber).

- LhA now maps foreign (MS-DOS) file attributes to Amiga attributes
  if the files were archived with level 1 or 2 headers on the source
  system.

V1.31 : private release

V1.30 : Apr 6 1992

- Significantly faster -lh5- and -lh1- compression. (registered)

- Fixed bug in level 1 header handling. Previously it would break 50% of
  the time on machines with 68000 processors. (Mats Nyman)

- Fixed xclose() bug. This would cause archives to disappear when the last
  file had been deleted. (Ola Olsson)

- Added new mode to `-x' option. In this mode the entire archived pathname
  is used when writing the files to the output device (like with `-x1' or
  `-x'), but not when selecting them (like with `-x0'). This mode is
  selected by using `-x3'.

- Added new mode to `-x' option. In this mode the entire archived pathname
  is used when selecting files to extract (like with `-x1' or `-x'), but
  not when writing the files to the output device (like with `-x0'). This
  mode is selected by using `-x2'. (Magnus Holmgren)

V1.23 : Apr 4 1992

- Fixed compression I/O error detection on archive temporary device.

- LhA now supresses requesters when looking for ENV: (Pavel Vána)

V1.22 : Apr 2 1992

- Fixed compression bug. Introduced in V1.20. Quite rare. (Mats Nyman)

- Changed `-y' option behaviour. Now no longer appends `.lha' or `.lzh'
  suffix if archive name already contains one (Thanks to Mats Nyman).

- Fixed problem where LhA would not restore file attributes with level 0
  headers even if you specified `-a' on extraction. (Thanks to Ken Krebs)

V1.20 : Mar 26 1992

- LhA now supports multivolume archives. On the evaluation version, only
  extracting and listing of multivolume archives is allowed. Currently
  the maximum number of volumes is 100 - if you go above this limit LhA
  won't complain but the behaviour is undefined (a crash is very likely
  to occur).

- LhA now appends a lower-case `.lzh' or `.lha' instead of the upper-case
  suffixes in earlier versions. (Purely cosmetic)

- Added support for OS2.0 local variables. Local variables override the
  global ENV:LHAOPTS if present.

- Added `S' response to queries. Pressing `s' will cause LhA to assume
  negative response to all following queries of the same class. (i.e.
  generally skipping all following files).

- Fixed bug in console font size detection on public screens other than
  the WB.

- Fixed problem with updating/deleting files in/from archives on another
  device than the one the working directory is on.

- LhA now reads default options from the environment variable LHAOPTS
  unless the `-I' switch is specified before the archive name. Note that
  the `-I' switch is special because it HAS to be specified directly
  after a dash (`-') like in "LhA -I a ram:test *.h", and not like this:
  "LhA -nI a ram:test *.h". You will get a warning message if LhA detects
  this. Specifying the `-I' option within LHAOPTS is not a good idea..

- Implemented `-H' switch. LhA can now write level 1 and level 2 headers.

- Fixed disk full detection problem when extracting stored files. (Juha
  Luoma).

- LhA now emits no ANSI sequences at all when listing archives.
  (A.J.Brouwer).

- Added `q' modifier to `l' and `v' commands to allow for creation of
  name-only archive listings. (Use `-N' option to suppress copyright
  msg).  (Niklas Sjöberg)

- Added `-Qd' option to make LhA ignore the delete protection file when
  moving files. (Will delete the file regardless of the delete protection
  flag state).

- Added `-Qw' option to cause LhA to ignore wildcards. Useful when
  processing files containing wildcard characters (`~[]()*#?%). (Paul van
  der Heu).

- LhA now can process SFX archives created with LhASFX. This means you can
  use LhA to test uploaded SFX archives on a BBS without taking the risk
  of running the `.RUN' file (which is dangerous since there's no way of
  knowing if it actually is a SFX archive or some type of `bomb').

- Changed command line parsing to enable user to archive entire volumes
  or directories simply by specifying `df0:' and `dir/' as action file
  specs if they are followed by another directory name or are last on the
  command line. Idea from Pavel Vàña. See manual for more detailed
  explanation.

- Added '-e' option to archive empty subdirectories (only valid when used
  together with '-r' option).

- Added '-d' option to set archive file date to that of the newest file in
  the archive.

- Added '-K' option to remove empty directories when moving files with the
  `m' command.

- Changed console reset sequence once more to please some console
  emulators.

- Added `-y' option to force suffix append.

- Added -lh4- compression switch (`-1') serves no real purpose but I added
  it for the sake of completeness.

- Fixed handling of level 2 headers. Would crash hard in earlier versions.

- LhA now supports all extended header types.

- All ARP dependencies removed. ARP is never used under KS2.x, but under
  1.x ARP will be used if pattern.library does not exist. If neither ARP
  nor pattern.library exists when running under KS1.x, LhA uses its
  internal (inferior) pattern matching routines handling `?' and `*'
  only.

- Added replace (`r') command. Works like update command but replaces
  files in archive regardless of datestamps. (Same effect as `u' command
  with option `-Qr').

- Added `-Qr' option. This option disables the datestamp comparison for
  the `f' and `u' commands, so all files that exists in the archive will
  be replaced regardless of file modification dates.

- Fixed cosmetic problem when using the `-n' option with the add/update
  commands. Would emit one linefeed for every present file in the
  archive.

- Added `-Qd' option to delete autoshow files after showing/extracting.

- Rewrote the -lh1- encoding routines in assembler, now -lh1- compression
  is about 1.6 times faster than before. (REGISTERED version only)

- LhA now recognizes `.ZOM' files as being compressed and will not attempt
  further compression. (Olaf Barthel)

- Implemented `-h' option to disable the homedir facility. Useful when
  running ToolManager, which passes directories as `dirname/'. (Oliver
  Knorr).

- Implemented `-Qo' option to disable options after the command. Useful
  when running automated BBS file testing. (Suggested by Frederick Page)
  When this option is enabled all options must be specified before the
  command, like in LZ and LHArc.

- Fixed bug in the automatic stack allocation code, which would cause LhA
  to crash when run together with MungWall with a CLI stack size of less
  than 6000 bytes. (Chris Green at CBM). The minimum stack size has also
  been reduced to 4000 bytes.

- Some central list handling routines rewritten in assembler to reduce
  size.

- When listing archives, LhA now prints years after 2000 in only two
  digits (before it was displayed as 100 etc. ). Normally, files with
  these dates have invalid datestamps.

- The `p' command now no longer emit the in-between-file message or the
  console reset sequence when the `-q' option is used. `-n' can be used
  to suppress the in-between-file message alone. (Loren J. Rittle)

- Fixed cosmetic `bug' caused by bug in KS1.3 console device. (Michael
  Beer).

- Fixed progress indicator type 2 & 3 bug. Earlier versions would die
  when extracting zero-length files or empty directories with the `-D2'
  or `-D3' options. Thanks to Camillo Särs for reporting.

V1.11 : Jan 19 1992

- Fixed packing progress indicator type 3 (-D3) glitch.

- Fixed the last bug in compression. The compression ratio has also been
  improved slightly over V1.10 (Thanks to Stefan Becker for reporting).

- Fixed a few `bugs' in the manual.

- Add operations now respect the -N option setting.

- Add operations now respect the -F option setting.

V1.10 : Jan 13 1992

Major update; [all in a weeks work]

- Bug in compression fixed, would show up mostly on large files, but had
  nothing to do with the size of the file really. This bug only affected
  LHA (-lh5-) compression. Because of the nature of this bugfix, the LHA
  compression is now better than before - but the difference is very
  slight.

- Fixed rare bug in decompression code (several persons reported this and
  the offending file had been hatched via ADS). Handling of corrupted
  archives improved as well - V1.00 would crash on some bad data. This
  release will never do so.

- Bug fixed where LhA would report an error and leave the temporary
  archive in the working directory. This happened when updating or
  deleting files in an archive on the same device as the work directory.
  Cause: DeleteFile in dos.library returns TRUE if delete was OK, and
  FALSE otherwise, I thought it was the other way around. (That's what
  you get for not reading the docs carefully enough).

- Fixed stupid bug where LhA would refuse to do anything to delete-
  protected files, even if you didn't want to write to the file.

- Fixed minor problem where LhA poked outside allocated memory (allocated
  2 bytes too little for two buffers), this had no real effect however as
  the memory being stepped on never could get used by any other task
  anyway. (thanks to Peer Hasselmeyer for discovering this bug with
  MungWall).

- Progress indicator update rate is now 4096 bytes in compression. Still
  hardcoded however.

- Fixed problem where some corrupted archives or too long level 2 headers
  would cause LhA to crash. (Thanks to Jerry Sandstedt for reporting and
  supplying an offending archive).

- Fixed problem when arp.library could not be opened. Now exits cleanly
  with a message and error return code.

- LhA now reports already existing files (a and m commands) differently.
  In previous versions the source file with the whole path was printed,
  now LhA lists the name of the file as stored in the archive.

- Recursive file collection changed somewhat, any explicit filespec will
  now be looked for only in the current home directory, and not in all
  scanned directories as before. If you want the old behaviour enclose the
  name in parantheses. By explicit filespec I mean a filespec without any
  wildcard characters.

- If a directory name (without trailing `/' or `:') is specified as an
  action file with (a,f,u,m) commands, it is translated to `dir/*'. i.e.
  LhA will archive all files in that directory; if the `-r' option is
  enabled (recursive file collection) all files in the directory and it's
  subdirectories will be archived. Useful when using together with disk
  utilities such as Browser, DirOpus etc. Note that you cannot use this
  technique to archive an entire device/assigned directory, since LhA will
  treat this as a home directory specification. In this case, 'device:*'
  or `device:#?' must be used.

- Archive attributes are no longer set to ----rw-d by default, on request
  from WB users. It can still be switched on with the -A switch however.

- When attribute preservation is off, LhA now sets the attribute field on
  added files to --p-rwed (0x20) for MS-DOS compatibility.

- Attributes are no longer preserved by default on extract commands. The
  archive update commands (a,f,u,m) still preserve attributes by default
  however.

- Changed `vv' command, now all fields are OK.

- LhA now emits a warning if the first action file specification is an
  explicit (no wildcards) name and the file does not exist. No error code
  is returned to the shell.

- LhA now returns an error code when no archive matches the archive spec.

- Fixed bug where LhA would print the wrong byte count for certain failed
  memory allocations. Purely cosmetic.

- Worked around problem (bug?) in arp.library pattern matching routines.
  A pattern such as #> would cause memory corruption in prior versions of
  LhA. Although the arp documentation states that PreParse() will never
  produce parsed strings longer than the original, it sometimes does.
  (Thanks to Gary Chapman for reporting this problem)

- Printout fixed for extraction with `-t' and `-T' options, now only
  prints the names of the files that were actually extracted.

- Re-enabling of cursor changed to make certain console emulators happy.
  (Thanks to A.J.Brouwer)

- Recursive file collection fixed. No longer scans unnecessary directories
  when explicit filespecs are given.

- Files with names beginning with a dash (`-') can now be specified on
  the command line by using double-dashes (`--') as stated in the
  manual.

- Files beginning with an at-sign (`@') can now be specified by using
  double at-signs.

- Manual tidied up and corrected to treat the evaluation version only. No
  more references to registered-user-only options, commands or programs.

- LhA now supports LhArc-style autoshow files. Autoshow files are files
  with names ending in `.displayme' (case insignificant).

- Option (`-M') added for disabling of autoshow files. Autoshow files are
  disabled by default when the `-m' option is used.

- LhA now promptly aborts with an error condition if a file cannot be
  opened for archiving. (Thanks to Magnus Holmgren for reporting this
  problem).

- `Warning: premature end of file, no archive terminator seen' message
  removed, since many people thought this was a bug with LhA. Served no
  real purpose anyway.

- Freshen command implemented.

- LhA now restores empty subdirectories as created by AmigaDOS LhArc 1.30
  (with `-re' option) does not yet archive them however.

- LhA extract commands now accept a destination-directory specification
  anywhere on the command line.

- LhA now deletes temporary archives from the working directory when an
  update or freshen operation is interrupted.

V1.00 : Released Dec 20 1991

- First public release
